# Installation

I've made automated scripts to install all necessary packages and pull the
dotfiles on your machine. Make sure to read the instructions in their
corresponding repositories.

- [Arch](https://github.com/somanoir/noir-archinstall)
- [Fedora](https://github.com/somanoir/noir-fedorainstall)

# Known Issues

> Qt themes seem to behave unpredictably outside KDE Plasma (inconsistent
> background color, broken buttons and menus, etc). Might be worth leaving them
> with default styles.

> On Fedora, packaged cava doesn't respect orientation = horizontal property.
> Building cava from source fixes the issue.
> (https://github.com/karlstav/cava?tab=readme-ov-file#from-source)

> On Fedora, initial launch of Steam requires the following env variable (launch
> from terminal): __GL_CONSTANT_FRAME_RATE_HINT=3 steam
